# TypeScript Calculator

This repository contains a simple TypeScript calculator that demonstrates a minimal GUI example.

## Running the Calculator

1. Ensure you have Node.js and TypeScript installed.
2. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the TypeScript source:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Open `index.html` in your browser to use the calculator interface. You can
   also run the following command to build and open the file automatically on
   Linux:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Make sure `npm run build` has completed before opening `index.html`.
